Let's make our hands dirty with React and Redux.



Here let's build an E-commerce application with the following features.



    -- Should display the inventory of the products that are kept for sale.



    -- Should display the Product with the title, price and quantity.



    -- Button with text 'Add to cart' should be displayed at each product.



              -- When we click on the button then the product should be added to the cart.

              -- As we add an item to cart the quantity of the item should be decreased in the inventory. 

              -- When the quantity of product in inventory is 0 the button should be disabled and the text on the button                  should be changed to 'Sold Out'.



    -- Initially when the cart is empty it should display the message 'You can add some products to cart.' and the              Checkout button should be disabled.



    -- When a product is added to the cart it should be displayed.



    -- When we add other products to cart the total price should be calculated and displayed.



    -- When we click the checkout button at the end the cart should be refreshed and the checkout button should be              disabled. 



Please make use of the api folder provided for the product list.
